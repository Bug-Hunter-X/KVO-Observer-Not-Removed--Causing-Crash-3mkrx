In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not removed properly when it's no longer needed, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  For example, if a view controller observes a model object, and the view controller is deallocated before removing the observer, the observer will attempt to access memory that has been freed, causing a crash. This can be hard to debug because the crash might occur much later and far away from the original mistake.
